- [NOSwallet](https://github.com/NOS-Cash/NOSvault) - The main wallet application (UI + Seed Generation/Block Signing/Etc).
- [NOSwallet-Server](https://github.com/NOS-Cash/NOSvault-server) - Serves the Wallet UI and brokers public communication between the wallet and the NOS Node.
- [NOSwallet-WS](https://github.com/NOS-Cash/NOSvault-ws) - Websocket server that receives new blocks from the NOS node and sends them in real time to the wallet ui.
